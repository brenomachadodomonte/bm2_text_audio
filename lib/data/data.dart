Eles moravam em uma remota fazenda no oeste da Inglaterra, e que par de tolos eles eram! Qual deles era o mais tolo? Escute a história e decida você mesmo. Naqueles dias, existia também um velho soldado chamado Jack Hannaford. Seu casaco era velho e ele era pobre, mas ninguém pensava que Jack Hannaford era bobo. Ele era astuto como uma raposa. Quando ele deixou o exército, ele caminhou por todo o país, procurando por maneiras de fazer suas artimanhas. Depois de ter viajado por algum tempo, ele deu de cara com a fazenda que pertencia ao casal. Ele bateu na porta da casa e pouco depois a esposa respondeu. Ela o olhou de cima a baixo, muito surpresa, porque poucos desconhecidos era capazes de fazer a difícil jornada até a casa deles. “De onde você veio?”, ela perguntou.',

Do you re-grab the hose and pull everything out again to finish the job properly, or do you say “You know, that’s good enough. That’s good enough.”? The thing about good enough is we don’t know if it’s enough. Until the nth hour, the final hour when everything is on the line! That’s when we find out if it is enough. And if we come up short, doesn’t that suck? I promise you, if today you never say “good enough”, tomorrow, you will always have enough. It’s the character of who you are. It’s not the title that makes you. It’s not the success that makes you. The character defines the success, defines the fame and it starts right there. Championships aren’t won in the theater of the arena. They’re won in the thousands of hours in the training room, the laps, and the 5:00 AM runs when it’s raining and everyone else is sleeping. That’s when it’s won. The heart of a champion is a light switch that’s always on. It doesn’t go on and off when someone is watching. It’s constant. It’s how you look at something. If your name is attached to it, that you do it right, to the best of your ability, every single time. If you’re dusting your countertops, do you dust around the picture frame, or do you pick it up and dust the entire thing? Do the job right or don’t do it at all. That’s the same person who has his hand raised on the podium one day. The exact same person! How you hold yourself in the small things of life build the character winning blocks of the things that we’re remembered for. I see them as one and the same. Do you hold yourself to the highest standards, even right now when no one else is looking? What do you do when no one is watching says a lot about what you do when they are. If you do it then, I guarantee you, you will be doing it when everyone is watching.',
